# Security awareness training

For most people, the phrase "security awareness training" conjours memories of
videos you can't fast forward through, slides you don't care about and just
plain boredom. The sad thing is, it security awareness training doesn't have
to be this way! So today I want to share my thoughts on how to build a security
awareness training program that:

 1. Isn't incredibly boring (and so purely for compliance purposes)
 2. Will stick with your staff for very, very long periods of time

# First things first: NIST 800-50
If you've never read [NIST 800-50](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-50.pdf), you should. While it's certainly dry, and fairly old, it containes invaluable information. So go read it and then come back here.

# How to make security awareness training fun and impactful

## Make it real

It's easy to run through examples that you copy-pasta from the internet -
here's what the definition of `spam` is, here's the definition of `encryption`.
The thing is, none of that is useful without a connection that makes it
personal, or at least more tangible, for each indvidual completing security
awareness training. So how do we make it more real? Share real life examples!
Here are a few that I personally share in the most recent new-hire/shared
background security awareness training that we do:


### Make it real (1): Full disk encryption
TBD

### Make it real (2): SMS based MFA
TBD

### Make it real (3): Chrome extension spyware
TBD

## Teach people how to do it
TBD

### Teaching (1): Phishing
TBD

### Teaching (2): MITM attacks and network eavesdropping
TBD
